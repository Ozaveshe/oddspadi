      "A prediction should be an argument you can inspect, not a score dropped from the sky. OddsPadi starts with the fixture, recent performance and the market price, then checks whether the information is complete enough to support a public view.",
      "The model probability is only one part of that view. We compare it with the bookmaker's implied probability, account for margin, and look for a meaningful difference. A large-looking edge can still be rejected when team news, lineups or price coverage are weak.",
      "That is why ‘no clear value’ is a useful result. It means the available evidence does not justify a stronger claim. As kickoff approaches and better information arrives, the same match can move from watchlist to actionable—or remain an honest pass."
